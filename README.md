Is a quicker way to start with Expo + Firebase projects. It includes:

- navigation using `react-navigation` 4.x.x
- Firebase as backend for email auth
- uses Firestore to store user data
- handles different field types in forms
- handles server errors using Formik
- Login/Signup form built using Formik & yup
- uses `react-native-elements`
- show/hide Password Field's visibility üëÅ
- uses Context API & checks user's auth state
- based on Expo SDK 34.x.x

## Installation

- Clone this repo
- to install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
- rename the file `example.firebaseConfig.js` to `firebaseConfig.js`
- and make sure to add your own Firebase config in this file:

```js
// Rename this file to "firebaeConfig.js" before use
// Replace all Xs with real Firebase API keys
export default {
  apiKey: 'XXXX',
  authDomain: 'XXXX',
  databaseURL: 'XXXX',
  projectId: 'XXXX',
  storageBucket: 'XXXX',
  messagingSenderId: 'XXXX',
  appId: 'XXXX'
}
```

Expo uses Firebase Web SDK and does not support all Firebase services such as phone auth. If you are looking forward to use those services, please use `react-native-firebase` in a vanilla react native app.
